# RUMBLE HUD Mod

This mod adds a HUD to the RUMBLE display on your monitor, for use in streaming
RUMBLE or recording gameplay.

The mod will, for each player, display their:
  - Name
  - Battle Points
  - Current Health
  - Equipped Shift Stones
  - Player Portrait
  - Host status (optional)

## Controls

The mod currently uses the following controls:
  - `I` to toggle HUD on/off
  - `O` to cycle between host indicator options:
    - None
    - Text only
    - Icon only
    - Both text and Icon
  - `P` to regenerate player portraits
    - Your own portrait can only be regenerated while in the gym
  - `-`/`=` (near the backspace key) to decrease/increase HUD scale

The HUD scale currently saves to a settings file: `UserData/RumbleHud.xml`.
**Note:** Settings save on game quit, so RUMBLE crashing might mean your 
settings don't save.

## Settings File

| Setting Key | Type | Default Value | Description |
|-------------|------|---------------|-------------|
| `HudScale` | float | 1.0 | The size of the HUD. Keep it strictly positive. Control in-game using `-` and `=`. |
| `HostIndicator` | `None`, `Text`, `Icon`, or `Both` | `Text` | How to indicate who is host on the HUD. Cycle in-game using `O`. |
| `HideSolo` | boolean (`true` or `false`) | `false` | Whether to auto-hide the HUD when you are the only player. Cannot be set in-game. |

## Dependencies

This mod requires:
 - MelonLoader 0.7.0

## Installation Instructions

1. Extract the `Mods` and `UserData` folders into your RUMBLE install directory.

## Known Issues

- Metals in Challenger's Pauldron (at least) are currently transparent in player portrait.
- Incompatible with LIV camera
- Portrait generation for the player only occurs when entering the gym
  - To update your own portrait, press `P` while you are in the gym
- Opponents can have their portrait taken while they're in awfully unflattering poses, e.g. full scorpion.
  - This is funny as hell, not fixing this
- In parks, if you're unlucky, other player portraits can be photobombed
  - This is also funny as hell, not fixing this

## Future Goals

- Allow for portrait regeneration on key press.
- Extensive config with `rumblehud.xml`
  - Allow deeply customisable HUDs by having element positionings be config values.
- Investigate LIV support
- Integrate with RumbleModUI to expose configuration options:
  - Hide or show HUD
  - Re-generate player portraits
  - Rearrange ordering of players on the HUD.
- Support for NameBending
- Score tracking
- Make shift stone icons pulse/shimmer when triggered/active
- Is it possible to use OSC or host a server? Something that could expose this information outside of RUMBLE, so someone familiar with OBS could make their own elements in OBS instead using this info?
  - This could be a workaround for supporting LIV for serious streaming setups.

## Support

Reach out to me on Discord (kpaiy) if you have issues or feature requests.
I can't guarantee fast response times, but I'll do what I can. ^-^
